                <div class="item2"><p>My favorite team is FunPlus Phoenix, or better known as FPX. They are a Chinese League of Legends team who won the 2019 World Championship.</p>
                    <p>Their midlaner, Doinb, plays very unorthodox champions that go against the meta. He plays tanks and other supportive champions in a lane where you are supposed to prioritize being the damage carry. A lot of other players often berated and looked down on him for his weird picks, but he simply proved them wrong. He took his signature champion Nautilus (who is normally a support champion) in the 2019 World Finals, and completely demolished the opposing midlaner.</p></div>

                <div class="item2"><p>- The name of the song for Worlds 2019 Championship Tournament was "Phoenix" and the team that happened to win just so happened to be named FunPlus Phoenix.</p>
                <p>- The midlaner, DoinB, got married the year before the start of the 2019 League of Legends professional season, so many analys jokingly attribute his success that year to the "Wife Buff"</p>
                <p>- Fun Plus Phoenix was given the "Best Team" award on November 2019</p>
                <p>- Fun Plus Phoenix is an international team that has imported players from different countries. Their star midlaner and steadfast toplaner, Doinb and GimGoon, are from Korea while the rest of the roster is composed of Chinese players.</p></div>
